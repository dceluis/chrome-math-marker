Below are instructions on how to set up, develop, and build this extension. You can then add the built project to Chrome using the Developer Extension Dashboard.

## Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/username/chrome-math-marker.git
cd chrome-math-marker
```

## Installing Dependencies

We use [Bun](https://bun.sh/) as our package manager. If you haven't installed Bun yet, see their documentation for the installation process.

After installing Bun, run:

```
bun install
```

(This will install all the required dependencies.)

## Running the Development Server

To start a development version of the extension, run:

```
bun run dev
```

This will bundle the extension for a local development environment. The dev build can be reloaded or tested in a local browser environment (e.g., Chrome or Firefox).

### Firefox Development

If you want to run the extension in Firefox:

```
bun run dev:firefox
```

## Building for Production

When you're ready to build a production version of the extension:

```
bun run build
```

For Firefox:

```
bun run build:firefox
```

## Adding to Chrome (Locally)

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Go to the Extensions page by browsing to **chrome://extensions/**.
3. Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top-right corner.
4. Click on **Load unpacked**.
5. Select the folder that was generated by the build command (it typically has the pattern **chrome-mv3** and is present in the **.output** folder).
   After that, you should see the Math Marker extension in the list of installed extensions.

## Environment Variables

If you need to enable certain features (like the clipping tool), you can create a `.env` file in the project root (based on `.env.sample`):

```
WXT_ENABLE_CLIP_TOOL=true
WXT_CLIP_TOOL_ENDPOINT="https://example.com/endpoint"
```

Then re-run the build steps to incorporate those environment variables.

> [!NOTE]
> The clipping tool is still very buggy and may not work as expected in all cases.


## Contributing

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for improvements or bug fixes. This is an experimental extension that enables writing math on any webpage.
